Some experts lean toward the theory that it might be a genetic, inherited condition since women who have it are more likely to have a sister or mother who also has it. Most feel that women with PCOS have a defect in insulin or insulin secretion that leads to the disease, that is why women with PCOS are more likely to get diabetes. ",
