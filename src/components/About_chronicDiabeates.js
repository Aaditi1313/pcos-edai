                <h3 class="heading_content">Abnormal Lipids in PCOS</h3>
                <p class="content">Dyslipidemia is a widespread metabolic condition in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome diseases. Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome are prone to suffer from high LDL levels or “bad” cholesterol, which, if failed to have controlled, can lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Conversely, women with PCOS also tend to have lowered levels of good cholesterol, which can further augment the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

As a general rule, lower LDL levels and higher HDL levels play a vital role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome sufferers are prone to hyperinsulinemia, which means exceptionally high levels of insulin the blood, which causes the liver to secrete more lipids causing a high risk for heart diseases.</p>

<h3 class="heading_content">Insulin Resistance in polycystic ovarian syndrome diseases</h3>
<p class="content">Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and insulin resistance co-exist and share a common factor. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas, a gland in the abdomen programmed to perform several functions. It is secreted typically in response to high glucose levels in the blood, which then under the controlled action of insulin gets absorbed within the cells and used for energy production. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome chronic problems frequently have insulin resistance, meaning the body fails to respond to insulin, thus losing firm control over the blood glucose levels adequately. Consistently high levels of glucose in the blood can lead to diabetes.

Insulin is known as an appetite stimulant, and people with high insulin levels frequently experience a craving for sugar and sweet substances, which can further lead to high glucose levels in the blood, worsening diabetes, and associated complications.

<h3 class="heading_content">Pre-Diabetes & PCOS</h3>
<p class="content">A condition called pre-diabetes increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions. During this stage, which can last as long as 10 to 12 years, the body is no longer as sensitive to insulin as it may have been before.

Pre-diabetes is a condition lasting for 10-12 years. However, blood glucose levels are normal; the body’s cells start progressively reducing their response to insulin, which can eventually lead to the development of type-2 diabetes in the future. As PCOS is a recognized risk factor for type-2 diabetes, it further mandates for women with PCOS to follow-up on their blood sugar levels regularly.</p>

<h3 class="heading_content">Cardiac Problems in PCOS</h3>
<p class="content">Women with PCOS are at the double risk of atherosclerosis (plaque deposits in the arteries) than women without the syndrome, according to a new study. It severely raises the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a blanket term to describe a disorder that can adversely affect the heart itself or the system of heart and blood circulation (cardiovascular system). Conditions that contribute to heart disease include high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries caused by calcium deposits), atherosclerosis, and more. High glucose levels and insulin resistance in PCOS can further contribute to or add to the already existing state of coronary heart disease.

However, to get firm control of these symptoms and manage them effectively, a multi-dimensional approach towards this problem is necessary. A complete system is required to address these issues. This system should include nutraceuticals (vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and botanicals formulated to address specific conditions), a realistic exercise program, nutritional guidance and a support network that will help you change unhealthy lifestyle.</p>
